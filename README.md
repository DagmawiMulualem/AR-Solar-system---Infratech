Developed an AR-based Solar System app during my internship at Infretech, leveraging Xcode, Swift, and ARKit. 
The app includes features such as adjustable planet rotation speed, interactive descriptions for each planet, and zoom functionality, 
all designed to create immersive and engaging learning experiences for students worldwide.
